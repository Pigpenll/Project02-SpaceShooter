Space shooter game in which you progress through levels that feature waves of enemies. Upgrade your ship as you fight through them!
## Implementation
I have a ship that moves and shoots, at least two enemies, and a scoring system (levels).

+1 point for kenney-sourced assets
+3 points for three different enemies with unique behaviours and attacks
+2 points for multiple levels with different enemies (11 total levels!)
+additional points for different type of space shooter. There are waves of unique enemies that you fight. You upgrade your ship as you progress through the game while the levels get more difficult.
